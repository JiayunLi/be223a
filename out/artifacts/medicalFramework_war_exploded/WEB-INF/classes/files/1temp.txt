EXAM: CT LUNG LOW DOSE WO CONTRAST 2015-01-01 09:55:00     COMPARE:  No prior CT Chest available for comparison.     HISTORY:  Baseline lung screen     TECHNIQUE:  A low dose helical CT CHEST was performed on a Siemens multi-detector scanner.  The chest was studied in helical mode with prospective reconstructions of 1 and 3 mm slice thickness at dFOV = 38 cm using a low radiation dose technique. Coronal   and sagittal reformation and MIPS were reconstructed from the axial images.  NOTE:  This study was performed for the specific purposes of lung cancer screening and is not an alternative to diagnostic chest CT.     RADIATION DOSE:  1 Volumetric series was performed for this exam.     CTDIvol (CT dose Index-volume) = 0.13, 4.2 mG   DLP (Dose Length Product) = 146  mG cm       FINDINGS:  Indeterminate or Suspicious Lung Nodules (Category 3-4B): None.     Indeterminate/Non-actionable Nodules (Category 2): None.     Benign nodules (Category 1):  Present. Calcified peri-centimeter nodule in right lower lobe (3-73) and calcified micronodule in right upper lobe (3-40).     LUNG PARENCHYMA  Emphysema:  Absent.    Airways disease:  Bilateral bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis..    Fibrosis:  Present. Bilateral peripheral greater than central upper lobe and lower lobe, and right greater than left inter and intralobular septal thickening with loss of pleural parenchymal interface and architectural distortion.     OTHER ANATOMIC REGIONS  Lymph Nodes:  No significant mediastinal, axillary or hilar adenopathy present.  Pleura:  None.  Cardiac:  Mitral annular calcification. Focal atherosclerotic disease of left anterior descending and right coronary arteries.     Other findings:  Healed, and nonunited right rib fractures. Degenerative disease of spine.     IMPRESSION:  1. Lung Cancer Screening:    LungRADS Category 1, Negative screen.  Benign nodules seen only.  Recommend annual screening in 12 months .     2.  Mild bilateral peripheral, right greater than left pulmonary fibrosis, of indeterminate etiology and non specific pattern.        NOTES:     This report is based on the LungRADS Version1.0 algorithm ( Available at:  http://www.acr.org/Quality-Safety/Resources/LungRADS.       This study was designed exclusively for lung cancer screening and nodule detection.  The image quality is not intended to identify pathology in other organs and should not be used in lieu of a diagnostic CT for complete evaluation of the chest.        Current USPSTF recommendations are to annually screen asymptomatic individuals between the ages of 55-80 years with a current or former smoking history of minimum 30 pack years.  Former smokers should have quit within the preceding 15 years.  Individuals   with symptoms should undergo diagnostic chest CT rather than LDCT screening.
