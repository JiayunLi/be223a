EXAM: CT LUNG LOW DOSE WO CONTRAST 2015-01-01 16:10:00 COMPARE: None available. HISTORY: Greater than 44 years cigarette looking; quit 4 years prior. Baseline lung screen. TECHNIQUE: A low dose helical CT CHEST was performed on a Siemens multi-detector scanner.The chest was studied in helical mode with prospective reconstructions of 1 and 3 mm slice thickness at dFOV using a low radiation dose technique. Coronal   and sagittal reformation and MIPS were reconstructed from the axial images.NOTE: This study was performed for the specific purposes of lung cancer screening and is not an alternative to diagnostic chest CT. RADIATION DOSE: The patient received the following exposure event(s) during this study, and the dose reference values for each are as shown (CTDIvol in mGy, DLP in mGy-cm). Note that the values are not patient dose but numbers generated from scan    acquisition factors based on 32 cm (body, 'a') and/or 16 cm (head, 'b') phantoms and may substantially under-estimate or over-estimate actual patient dose based on patient size and other factors. Chest (1a, 48)     FINDINGS:  Indeterminate or Suspicious Lung Nodules (Category 3-4B): None.     Indeterminate/Non-actionable Nodules (Category 2): Subcentimeter nodule within the left upper lobe (3-91).     Benign nodules (Category 1): Coarsely calcified discrete and clustered subcentimeter nodules within the left lower lobe (3-306) and lingula (3-205).     LUNG PARENCHYMA  Emphysema: Absent.  Airways disease: Diffuse scattered peribronchial and ocular thickening with fecal stasis.  Fibrosis: Bands with architectural distortion within the lingula, consistent with postinflammatory pleural parenchymal scarring.     OTHER ANATOMIC REGIONS  Lymph Nodes: None clinically significant by CT size criteria.  Pleura: Normal.  Cardiac: Atherosclerotic calcification of the left anterior descending coronary artery.     Other findings: Calcified peri-centimeter splenic artery aneurysms.     IMPRESSION:  Lung Cancer Screening:    LUNGRads Category 2, Benign appearing (non-actionable) nodules seen. These types of nodules are commonly observed and require no immediate action. Recommend annual screening in 12 months.     NOTES:     This report is based on the LungRADS Version1.0 algorithm (Available at: http://www.acr.org/Quality-Safety/Resources/LungRADS).       This study was designed exclusively for lung cancer screening and nodule detection. The image quality is not intended to identify pathology in other organs and should not be used in lieu of a diagnostic CT for complete evaluation of the chest.Current USPSTF recommendations are to annually screen asymptomatic individuals between the ages of 55-80 years with a current or former smoking history of minimum 30 pack years. Former smokers should have quit within the preceding 15 years.Individuals with symptoms should undergo diagnostic chest CT rather than LDCT screening.       LungRADS
